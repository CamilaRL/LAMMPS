# LAMMPS
Graphics for reading and plotting of simulation's results. Some data extraction of mixtures are different, being in the folde `misturas`

Some of the codes may need some changes depending on the simulation:

- graph_E.py : starting and ending point to read line (line 15)
- graph_msd.py : starting point to read line (line 14)
